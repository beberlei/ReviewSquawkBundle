# Review Squawk Bundle

This bundle is an application that provides a static-code-analysis as a service platform for Github projects.
You can register your Github account with an Github application providing this service and then automatically
generate CodeSniffer violations as comments into the commits.

This bundle is beta. Its missing a bunch of features that will be added in the future for sure:

* Pull Request support
* PHPDepend, PHP Mess Detection, PHPCPD support
* Github Hook support
* Cronjobs for automatic processing of pull requests
* Other platforms support (Gerrit?)
* Other languages
* Support for private Github repositories

This bundle will the basis for a software as a service platform that allows open-source projects to use this service for free.
